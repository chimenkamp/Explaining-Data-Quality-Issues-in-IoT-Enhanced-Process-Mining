📝 DETAILED EXPLANATIONS: 18 high-priority issues

  --- EXPLANATION 1 ---
  Issue: Sensor sampling rate is insufficient to capture all process events (Confidence: 100.0%, Severity: medium)
  Technical: Inadequate sampling rate occurs when sensors sample too slowly to capture all relevant process events. This typically happens when fast-changing processes are monitored with low-frequency sensors, cau...
  Root Cause: Sensor sampling frequency is insufficient for process dynamics
  Business Impact: Medium
  Immediate Impacts:
  Priority: High
  Immediate Actions: Review and increase sensor sampling rates, Identify critical sensors with timing issues

  --- EXPLANATION 2 ---
  Issue: Sensor placement causes overlapping or inconsistent readings (Confidence: 100.0%, Severity: high)
  Technical: Poor sensor placement results in sensors providing overlapping, inconsistent, or incomplete coverage of the process. This can lead to ambiguous readings, missed events, or false event detection due to...
  Root Cause: Sensors are not optimally positioned for process monitoring
  Business Impact: High
  Immediate Impacts:
  Priority: Critical
  Immediate Actions: Audit current sensor positions, Map sensor coverage against process areas
